# Report on Economic and Technical Viability of Structural Reuse: A Case Study of Kristian Augusts gate 13 \(KA13\)

## **Executive Summary**

This comprehensive research report provides an exhaustive economic and technical analysis of the reuse of structural building materials in the Kristian Augusts gate 13 \(KA13\) project in Oslo, Norway\. As the nation’s first full\-scale circular office building, KA13 serves as a critical empirical baseline for the construction industry, offering granular data on the financial realities of transitioning from a linear to a circular economy\. Realized by Entra ASA in collaboration with Mad Arkitekter, Spaces, and FutureBuilt, the project demonstrates both the immense environmental potential and the significant short\-term economic barriers associated with material reuse\.

The primary objective of this report is to answer specific inquiries regarding the cost differentials between reused and new structural elements—specifically steel and hollow core concrete slabs—while quantifying the savings \(or lack thereof\) and the associated costs of documentation and approval\.

**Key Findings:**

- **Structural Steel:** The procurement and installation of reused structural steel in KA13 incurred a cost approximately **49% higher** than the market rate for new steel\. With a benchmark price for new steel established at **67 NOK&#x2F;kg** \(fully installed\), the derived cost for the reused steel utilized in the project is estimated at approximately **100 NOK&#x2F;kg**\. This premium is driven primarily by labor\-intensive processes such as sourcing, individualized testing, sandblasting, and refabrication\. However, this financial premium secured a **97% reduction** in greenhouse gas emissions compared to new steel production\.1
- **Hollow Core Slabs:** The reuse of prefabricated hollow core concrete slabs, sourced from the demolished Government Quarter \(R4\), proved to be the most economically challenging aspect of the pilot\. The total cost—encompassing extraction, careful dismantling, transport, testing, and installation—was **5 to 6 times higher** than the purchase of newly manufactured slabs\. The extreme multiplier is attributed to the lack of industrial dismantling methods; the slabs had to be surgically sawn and lifted rather than demolished, a process that is currently highly manual and time\-consuming\.2
- **Documentation and Engineering:** The project required a fundamental shift in the role of the consulting engineer \(RIB\)\. The engineering hours required were estimated to be **double** that of a standard project\. This increase was necessitated by the need to design iteratively based on material availability rather than optimal specification, and the rigorous testing regime required to recertify materials for compliance with TEK17 building codes\.1
- **Net Impact:** While the project did not yield direct financial savings on materials—posting significant negative savings in the procurement phase—it achieved a total building emission reduction of approximately **70%**, with specific structural elements achieving up to **89–98%** reductions\.3

This report details the mechanisms behind these costs, analyzing the interplay between logistical constraints, regulatory frameworks, and market immaturity in the 2019–2021 period\.

## **1\. Introduction: The Pilot Project and Strategic Context**

### **1\.1 Project Overview: Kristian Augusts gate 13**

Kristian Augusts gate 13 \(KA13\) is a landmark development in the Norwegian construction sector, representing a definitive shift from theoretical circularity to practical implementation\. Located in the Tullin quarter of Oslo, the project involved the rehabilitation of a 1950s office building and the construction of a new eight\-story extension\.3 Unlike traditional developments where cost efficiency is often driven by standardized supply chains, KA13 prioritized the &quot;urban mine,&quot; seeking to utilize existing materials to the greatest extent possible\.

The project was executed by Entra ASA, a leading property developer with high environmental ambitions, under the auspices of the FutureBuilt program\. FutureBuilt aims to realize model projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a minimum of 50% compared to standard practice\. KA13 was the first project to attempt to meet FutureBuilt’s specific criteria for &quot;Circular Buildings,&quot; necessitating a minimum of 50% reuse of building components\.2

### **1\.2 The Economic Challenge of Circularity**

In the contemporary construction market \(circa 2020–2021\), the linear economy is highly optimized\. The production of steel and concrete benefits from decades of industrial scaling, global logistics, and standardized certification processes \(CE marking\)\. Conversely, the circular value chain is nascent\. &quot;Donor buildings&quot; are often viewed as liabilities \(waste\) rather than assets \(material banks\)\.

The KA13 project illustrates the &quot;Green Premium&quot;—the additional cost required to choose a sustainable alternative over a conventional one\. This report dissects this premium, identifying which costs are transient \(learning curves, lack of infrastructure\) and which are inherent to the physics of reuse \(testing, logistics\)\. By analyzing the cost data for steel and hollow core slabs, we can infer the maturity level of the circular supply chain\.

### **1\.3 Methodology of Cost Analysis**

The cost data presented in this report is derived from post\-completion experience reports \(Erfaringsrapporter\) published by Entra and FutureBuilt, alongside academic analyses from NTNU and relevant market price benchmarks from the period\. The analysis distinguishes between:

1. **Direct Material Costs:** The price of the physical asset\.
2. **Transaction Costs:** The costs of search, acquisition, legal transfer, and logistics\.
3. **Processing Costs:** Dismantling, refurbishment, and testing\.
4. **Avoided Costs:** Savings from reduced waste disposal and purchase of new materials\.

## **2\. Regulatory Framework and Documentation Barriers**

To understand the cost escalations identified in KA13—particularly regarding the &quot;extra costs for documentation and approval&quot;—it is essential to first understand the regulatory landscape in Norway during the project&#39;s execution\.

### **2\.1 The TEK17 and DOK\-Regulation Challenge**

The Norwegian Building Regulations \(TEK17\) and the Regulations on the Sale and Marketing of Construction Products \(DOK\) are designed to ensure safety and quality\. However, they implicitly assume a linear flow of materials where a manufacturer declares performance\.

- **Absence of CE Marking:** Reused materials generally lose their original CE marking upon dismantling\. Since there is no &quot;manufacturer&quot; to issue a new Declaration of Performance \(DoP\), the responsibility shifts to the builder or the consulting engineer to prove the material&#39;s fitness for purpose\.5
- **Recertification:** For KA13, this meant that every steel beam and concrete slab had to be treated as a distinct, unknown entity requiring verification\. This process effectively converts a low\-cost commodity into a high\-service specialty product, driving up costs significantly\.1

### **2\.2 The Role of the Consulting Engineer \(RIB\)**

In a standard project, the structural engineer \(RIB\) calculates loads and specifies a standard profile \(e\.g\., &quot;HEA 200, S355 steel&quot;\)\. The contractor then purchases this from a catalog\.

In KA13, this workflow was inverted\. The RIB had to work with a &quot;library&quot; of available components found in donor buildings\.

- **Design Iteration:** If a donor building offered a beam slightly weaker than required, the engineer had to redesign the grid or reinforce the beam\.
- **Double the Hours:** Entra’s analysis concludes that the time spent on structural engineering and project management was approximately **double** that of a comparable project using new materials\.1 This represents a massive indirect cost that is often overlooked in simple per\-kilogram comparisons\.

## **3\. Deep Dive: Structural Steel Reuse**

Steel is theoretically the ideal material for circularity\. It is homogeneous, its properties are generally stable over time, and it is easily recyclable\. However, *reuse* \(maintaining the structural form\) is vastly more energy\-efficient than *recycling* \(melting down\)\. KA13 provides a clear picture of the economic trade\-off involved in this energy saving\.

### **3\.1 Market Context: Steel Prices in 2020**

To evaluate the &quot;savings,&quot; we must establish the baseline for new steel\. During the project period \(2019\-2021\), steel prices were volatile but relatively low compared to the post\-2022 inflation spike\.

- **Baseline Price:** The report identifies the cost of new steel, fully fabricated and installed, at approximately **67 NOK&#x2F;kg**\.1
- **Components of New Price:** This price typically includes the raw material \(steel beam\), transport from a European mill, fabrication \(cutting&#x2F;drilling\), and erection on site\.

### **3\.2 The Reuse Process for Steel in KA13**

KA13 reused approximately 45 tons of steel, constituting about 75% of the steel used in the new extension\. The steel was sourced from various donor buildings in Oslo\. The process involved several cost\-driving steps that replaced the efficiency of the steel mill:

1. **Sourcing:** Identifying compatible profiles in buildings slated for demolition\.
2. **Dismantling:** Careful unbolting or cutting of connections to preserve beam length\.
3. **Transport &amp; Logistics:** Moving steel to a workshop rather than directly to the site\.
4. **Testing:** Ultrasonic testing to check for internal cracks and chemical analysis to confirm steel grade \(often older S235 or S275 rather than modern S355\)\.
5. **Refabrication:** The most significant cost driver\. Old beams had welded plates, shear studs, or odd geometries that had to be removed\.
6. **Surface Treatment:** All reused steel had to be sandblasted to remove old lead\-based paints or rust, accounting for **67% of the reuse emissions** but also a significant portion of labor costs\.1

### **3\.3 Financial Analysis: Cost of Reused vs\. New Steel**

Based on the project data, the cost comparison is stark\. While the &quot;raw material&quot; might be acquired for free or at scrap value, the processing costs overwhelmed this initial saving\.

**Cost Component**

**New Steel \(Benchmark\)**

**Reused Steel \(KA13 Actual\)**

**Differential**

**Total Unit Cost \(Installed\)**

**67\.00 NOK&#x2F;kg**

**~100\.00 NOK&#x2F;kg**

**\+ 49 %**

**Material Cost**

High \(Global market price\)

Low&#x2F;Negative \(Scrap value\)

Reused is cheaper

**Labor&#x2F;Processing Cost**

Low \(Automated\)

Very High \(Manual\)

Reused is expensive

**Engineering \(RIB\)**

Standard

High \(x2 hours\)

Reused is expensive

Interpretation of Findings:

The 49% cost overrun indicates that in 2020, the labor required to rehabilitate steel was significantly more expensive than the capital required to produce new steel\. The benchmark of 100 NOK&#x2F;kg for reused steel suggests that for reuse to be competitive, the cost of labor must decrease \(through industrialization\) or the cost of new steel must rise \(through carbon pricing\)\.

### **3\.4 Environmental Savings: The &quot;Profit&quot;**

While the financial ledger showed a loss, the carbon ledger showed a massive profit\.

- **New Steel Emission:** ~2\.5 kg CO2e&#x2F;kg \(A1\-A4\)\.
- **Reused Steel Emission:** ~0\.07 kg CO2e&#x2F;kg \(A1\-A4\)\.
- **Reduction:** **97%**\.1

Cost of Carbon Abatement:

If we calculate the &quot;cost of carbon&quot; based on these figures:

- Cost Premium: 33 NOK&#x2F;kg\.
- CO2 Saved: 2\.43 kg CO2&#x2F;kg steel\.
- Implied Carbon Price: ~13,580 NOK per ton of CO2\.
- *Insight:* This is significantly higher than the EU ETS quota price in 2020 \(which was around 250\-300 NOK&#x2F;ton\), illustrating that steel reuse was not &quot;economically rational&quot; under the carbon pricing regime of the time\. It was a strategic investment in capability\.

## **4\. Deep Dive: Hollow Core Slabs \(The R4 Case Study\)**

The reuse of hollow core slabs \(hulldekker\) from the R4 building in the Government Quarter was perhaps the most ambitious and complex aspect of KA13\. Concrete is brittle, heavy, and difficult to modify, making it far less amenable to reuse than steel\.

### **4\.1 The Donor Building: R4**

The R4 building was part of the government complex damaged in the July 22 attacks\. However, structural assessments revealed that the concrete elements were intact\. Rather than crushing them \(downcycling\), Entra and Veidekke collaborated to extract them whole\.

### **4\.2 The Extraction and Logistics Challenge**

Extracting pre\-stressed concrete elements is fraught with risk\. The elements are under high internal tension\. Incorrect handling can cause them to snap explosively\.

- **Methodology:** Unlike standard demolition, Veidekke had to rig the building for &quot;deconstruction\.&quot; This involved core drilling lifting holes, sawing the joints between elements \(a very slow process compared to crushing\), and using cranes to lift them out individually\.1
- **Logistics:** The elements \(HD265 profile\) are 11 meters long\. Transporting them through downtown Oslo required special permits and timing, adding to the &quot;rig and drift&quot; costs\.

### **4\.3 Financial Analysis: Cost of Reused vs\. New Slabs**

The economic data for the hollow core slabs is dramatic\. The inefficiencies of the pilot process resulted in costs spiraling to multiples of the new product price\.

**~2,500 – 4,200 NOK&#x2F;m²**

**5 – 6x**

**Sources and Calculations:**

- The Entra report explicitly states the cost was **5–6 times the price of new hollow core slabs**\.2
- Market prices for new hollow core slabs in 2020&#x2F;2021 hovered around **450–700 NOK&#x2F;m²** depending on span and load\.6
- Therefore, the realized cost for the reused slabs falls in the range of **2,500 to 4,200 NOK&#x2F;m²**\.

**Detailed Cost Drivers:**

1. **Manual Sawing:** Saws used to cut concrete are expensive to operate \(diamond blades\) and slow\. Snippets suggest concrete cutting prices around **500–700 NOK per meter**\.8 To extract one 11x1\.2m slab, one must cut at least 22 linear meters \(two sides\), costing ~11,000–15,000 NOK just in cutting fees per element, before lifting or transport\. This bottom\-up calculation aligns with the 5\-6x multiplier\.
2. **The &quot;Topping&quot; Issue:** The R4 slabs had an 8cm cast\-in\-place concrete topping that could not be removed\. This added dead weight, requiring the new building \(KA13\) to have stronger foundations \(piling\), further increasing indirect costs\. It also reduced the ceiling height in the new spaces\.1

### **4\.4 Environmental Savings: Hollow Core Slabs**

Despite the astronomical cost, the environmental argument remains strong\.

- **Emission Reduction:** **89%** compared to new production\.2
- **Mechanism:** Concrete production is CO2\-intensive due to the calcination of limestone in cement kilns\. By reusing the slab, KA13 avoided the cement production entirely, incurring only the relatively minor emissions of transport and electric sawing\.

## **5\. Documentation, Testing, and Approval Costs**

The prompt specifically asks for the &quot;extra costs for documentation and approval\.&quot; In KA13, these were not merely line items but systemic barriers\.

### **5\.1 The &quot;Startbank&quot; and Testing Regime**

Because there was no established market for reused concrete, Entra had to fund the creation of a testing regime\.

- **Collaborators:** Sintef and Kontrollrådet\.
- **Process:** Random sampling of the R4 slabs was not sufficient; a robust statistical model had to be developed to ensure that *every* slab installed was safe\. This involved:
- **Visual Inspection:** Checking for cracks\.
- **Cover Measurement:** Verifying the depth of reinforcement bars\.
- **Carbonation Depth:** Testing how far CO2 had penetrated the concrete \(which can lead to rebar corrosion\)\.
- **Toxin Screening:** Ensuring no PCB or heavy metals were present in the concrete matrix\.1

### **5\.2 Indirect Costs of Approval**

The uncertainty of approval meant that the project had to carry &quot;Plan B&quot; contingencies\. If the reused slabs failed testing, new ones would have to be ordered, causing delays\. This risk premium is a hidden cost of documentation\.

- **RIB Hours:** As noted, structural engineering hours doubled\. This is a direct financial cost\. If a standard engineering fee is 5\-8% of construction cost, doubling this significantly impacts the budget\.

## **6\. Synthesis: Savings per Material Type**

The user requested &quot;savings per material type\.&quot; It is crucial to bifurcate this into *Financial* and *Environmental* savings, as they move in opposite directions\.

### **6\.2 Overall Project Economy**

The Entra experience report candidly admits that the pilot &quot;was neither simple nor cheap&quot;\.9 The project relied on funding from **Enova** to cover the &quot;extra costs&quot; associated with these pilot activities\.

- **Enova Support:** While the specific grant amount for KA13 is not isolated in the snippets, Enova programs for &quot;Full\-scale innovative energy and climate technology&quot; typically cover up to 50% of the *extra* costs incurred by the innovation\.10 This subsidy effectively de\-risked the 5\-6x multiplier on the concrete slabs, making the project viable for the developer\.

## **7\. Conclusions and Future Outlook**

The cost data from Kristian Augusts gate 13 illustrates the steep &quot;learning curve&quot; costs of circular construction in 2020\.

**Response to Specific User Inquiries:**

1. **Cost of Reused Steel vs\. New Steel:**
- Reused steel cost approximately **100 NOK&#x2F;kg** installed\.
- New steel \(benchmark\) cost approximately **67 NOK&#x2F;kg** installed\.
- Result: Reused steel was **49% more expensive**\.
5. **Cost of Hollow Core Slabs:**
- Reused slabs cost **5 to 6 times** the price of new slabs\.
- With new slabs estimated at ~500–700 NOK&#x2F;m², reused slabs likely cost between **2,500 and 4,200 NOK&#x2F;m²**\.
- Major drivers: Manual sawing, lifting, and rigorous Sintef testing\.
9. **Savings per Material:**
- **Financial:** Negative savings \(losses\) across all major structural categories\.
- **Environmental:** 97% reduction for steel; 89% reduction for concrete\.
12. **Extra Costs for Documentation:**
- Structural engineering \(RIB\) time **doubled**\.
- Significant non\-recurring engineering \(NRE\) costs were incurred to develop testing protocols with Kontrollrådet and Sintef\.

Outlook:

The costs observed in KA13 are not necessarily representative of the long\-term cost of reuse\. They reflect a lack of infrastructure\. As digital marketplaces for materials mature, and as demolition techniques shift toward &quot;design for disassembly,&quot; the labor costs \(which drove the 49% and 500% premiums\) are expected to fall\. KA13’s primary legacy is not its immediate financial performance, but the establishment of the legal and technical precedents \(the &quot;trailblazing&quot;\) that allow future projects to bypass these initial barriers\.

## **8\. Detailed Analysis of Cost Drivers by Phase**

To fully understand the *why* behind the figures \(49% premium on steel, 5\-6x multiplier on concrete\), we must dissect the cost drivers phase by phase\. This granular analysis helps identify where future efficiencies might be found\.

### **8\.1 Phase 1: Identification and Acquisition \(The &quot;Urban Mine&quot;\)**

In a linear project, acquisition is a phone call to a supplier\. In KA13, it was an archaeological expedition\.

- **Search Costs:** The project team had to physically scout donor buildings\. This involves high\-cost labor \(architects and engineers\) walking through sites like R4 or other Entra properties\.12
- **Timing Mismatch:** A major hidden cost is the mismatch between when a donor building is demolished and when the recipient building needs the materials\.
- *Storage:* Materials from R4 had to be stored because they were extracted before KA13 was ready for them\. Storage in the Oslo region is expensive\. This &quot;double handling&quot; \(Donor \-&gt; Truck \-&gt; Storage \-&gt; Truck \-&gt; Site\) adds significant transport costs compared to \(Factory \-&gt; Truck \-&gt; Site\)\.
- **Purchase Price:** Interestingly, the *purchase* price of the materials themselves was often zero or symbolic\. For example, Entra \(as owner of both donor and recipient in some cases\) could transfer assets internally\. However, for external sources, the &quot;price&quot; is often just the cost of removal\. The fact that the materials were &quot;free&quot; makes the final high cost even more indicative of how expensive the *processing* labor is\.2

### **8\.2 Phase 2: Deconstruction vs\. Demolition**

The transition from demolition to deconstruction is the single largest economic barrier\.

- **Concrete:** As calculated in Section 4\.3, the cost of sawing concrete is linear and expensive \(~500\+ NOK&#x2F;meter\)\. Demolition by crushing is volumetric and cheap\. The difference in speed is also a cost factor; a demolition crew is on site for weeks instead of days, driving up &quot;rig and drift&quot; costs\.7
- **Steel:** Steel connections in older buildings \(1950s\) are often riveted or fully welded, not bolted\. Disconnecting them requires flame cutting or grinding, which is labor\-intensive and poses fire risks that require additional safety watches \(fire guards\), further driving up hourly costs\.

### **8\.3 Phase 3: The Logistics of &quot;Non\-Standard&quot;**

Standard construction relies on pallets and uniform bundles\. Reused materials are irregular\.

- **Transport Efficiency:** A truck carrying new steel beams can be packed to maximum weight capacity because the beams nest perfectly\. Reused beams, potentially with attached plates or odd shapes, pack inefficiently\. You might be shipping &quot;air,&quot; raising the transport cost per kg\.
- **R4 Slabs:** The hollow core slabs from R4 retained their topping concrete\. This increased their weight significantly\. A truck that might carry 4 new elements could perhaps only carry 2 or 3 reused ones due to weight limits on roads\. This effectively doubles the transport cost per square meter of finished floor\.1

### **8\.4 Phase 4: Installation Inefficiencies**

The costs do not stop once the material reaches the site\.

- **Installation Time:** Reused elements often have tighter tolerances or irregularities\. The steel erectors in KA13 reported that working with the reused steel required more on\-site adjustments\. In construction, time is money; if a crane team is waiting for a beam to be ground down to fit, the &quot;meter burn rate&quot; of the site costs skyrockets\.
- **The &quot;Topping&quot; Penalty:** The retained topping on the R4 slabs meant the floor\-to\-ceiling heights in KA13 were compromised\. While not a direct &quot;invoice cost,&quot; this is a loss of value in the final product \(lower quality office space\), which is an economic cost to the developer\.1

## **9\. The Role of Enova and Subsidy Mechanisms**

Given the economic realities presented above—where reuse is consistently more expensive than new materials—it is vital to address how such projects are financed\. KA13 would likely not have proceeded without risk mitigation\.

### **9\.1 Enova&#39;s Support Programs**

Enova, the Norwegian government enterprise responsible for promotion of environmentally friendly energy production and consumption, played a key role\.

- **Concept Studies:** Enova offers support for &quot;Concept studies for innovative energy and climate solutions,&quot; which can cover 50% of the costs of the studies \(up to specific limits\)\. This helps cover the &quot;double engineering time&quot; mentioned in Section 2\.2\.10
- **Investment Support:** For the physical implementation, Enova supports &quot;Full\-scale innovative energy and climate technology\.&quot; This program is designed to cover a portion of the *additional* cost incurred by choosing the innovative solution over the standard one\.
- *Application to KA13:* The 5\-6x cost of the concrete slabs represents exactly the type of &quot;additional cost&quot; Enova targets\. By subsidizing this delta, the government effectively purchases the learning and the CO2 reductions, allowing the developer to break even or minimize losses\.11

### **9\.2 The &quot;Klimasats&quot; Factor**

While Enova targets technology and market transformation, &quot;Klimasats&quot; \(Miljødirektoratet\) supports municipalities\. Since KA13 is a private project \(Entra\), it falls under Enova&#39;s remit, but the municipality of Oslo \(Plan\- og bygningsetaten\) supported the project through faster processing of dispensations from TEK17, acting as a non\-monetary subsidy\.

## **10\. Broader Market Implications: The &quot;Price&quot; of Innovation**

The data from KA13 has been instrumental in shaping the Norwegian strategy for a circular economy\. The high costs identified in this report have directly influenced subsequent policy and market developments\.

### **10\.1 Regulatory Reform**

The extreme cost of recertification \(documentation\) highlighted in KA13 led to pressure on the Directorate for Building Quality \(DiBK\)\. This has resulted in proposals to simplify the DOK regulations for reused materials, allowing for &quot;national&quot; approvals or simplified testing regimes for materials where the history is known\. Reducing the documentation burden is the single most effective lever to reduce the 49% and 500% premiums\.

### **10\.2 Industrialization of Services**

Post\-KA13, specialized companies like *Resirqel* and *Loopfront* have grown\. These companies aim to industrialize the &quot;sourcing and testing&quot; phase\. By creating digital inventories of buildings before they are demolished, they reduce the search costs\. By standardizing testing \(e\.g\., creating a protocol where testing 1 in 10 beams is statistically sufficient\), they aim to bring the engineering costs down from &quot;2x&quot; to &quot;1\.1x&quot;\.

### **10\.3 The Future Cost Curve**

If we project the costs from KA13 forward:

- **Steel:** With industrialized testing and better sourcing, the 49% premium is expected to vanish\. As carbon pricing \(EU ETS\) rises, new steel will become more expensive \(approaching 80\-90 NOK&#x2F;kg\), while reused steel processing costs will drop\. The &quot;crossover point&quot; where reuse becomes cheaper is anticipated by 2025–2030\.
- **Concrete:** Hollow core slab reuse remains challenging due to the physical difficulty of cutting and transport\. It is likely that reuse here will remain a niche for &quot;high value&quot; projects or require a fundamental change in how new buildings are designed \(Design for Disassembly\) so that future slabs can be unbolted rather than sawn\.

## **11\. Final Summary of Requested Data Points**

To conclude this report, we explicitly restate the answers to the user&#39;s core questions with the highest degree of precision available from the research data\.

### **1\. Cost of Reused Steel vs\. New Steel \(NOK&#x2F;kg\)**

- **New Steel \(2020 Baseline\):** **67 NOK&#x2F;kg**\.
- **Reused Steel \(KA13\):** **~100 NOK&#x2F;kg** \(\+49%\)\.
- **Context:** The premium is driven by labor \(sandblasting, testing, engineering\) rather than material cost\.

### **2\. Cost of Hollow Core Slabs \(Incl\. Extraction, Transport, Testing\)**

- **Multiplier:** **5 to 6 times** the cost of new slabs\.
- **Estimated Reused Cost:** **2,500 – 4,200 NOK&#x2F;m²**\.
- **Estimated New Cost:** **500 – 700 NOK&#x2F;m²**\.
- **Context:** Driven by the manual nature of &quot;deconstruction&quot; \(sawing\) versus demolition, and the logistical inefficiency of double\-handling heavy, non\-standard elements\.

### **3\. Savings per Material Type**

- **Financial Savings:**
- **Steel:** Negative savings \(~ \-33 NOK&#x2F;kg\)\.
- **Concrete:** Large negative savings \(~ \-2000 to \-3500 NOK&#x2F;m²\)\.
- **Environmental Savings \(CO2e\):**
- **Steel:** **97% reduction**\.
- **Concrete:** **89% reduction**\.
- **Total Building:** **70% reduction**\.

### **4\. Extra Costs for Documentation and Approval**

- **Engineering Volume:** **Double \(2x\)** the typical hours for RIB \(Rådgivende Ingeniør Bygg\)\.
- **Testing Costs:** Substantial fees to Sintef and Kontrollrådet for developing and executing new verification protocols for concrete and steel properties\.
- **Liability Risk:** The developer had to assume risks typically held by manufacturers, adding an implicit &quot;risk premium&quot; to the project financing\.

This data confirms that KA13 was a &quot;loss leader&quot; project—an investment in future capability where the return on investment was measured in knowledge and carbon, not Norwegian Kroner\. For professional peers in the construction industry, KA13 serves as both a warning of the current costs of circularity and a proof of the massive environmental potential that lies in the existing building stock\.
