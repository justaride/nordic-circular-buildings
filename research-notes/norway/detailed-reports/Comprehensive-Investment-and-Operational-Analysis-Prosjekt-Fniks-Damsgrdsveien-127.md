# Comprehensive Investment and Operational Analysis: Prosjekt Føniks \(Damsgårdsveien 127\)

## **Executive Summary**

This report presents an exhaustive financial, technical, and strategic analysis of &quot;Prosjekt Føniks,&quot; the rehabilitation and transformation of Damsgårdsveien 127 in Bergen, developed by Frydenbø Eiendom\. As a pilot project within the FutureBuilt program, Føniks represents a paradigmatic shift in commercial real estate development, moving from linear consumption models to a circular economy framework with a target of near 100% material reuse\.1

While specific proprietary capital expenditure \(CAPEX\) ledgers are internal to Frydenbø Eiendom and not publicly disclosed in granular detail 3, this analysis reconstructs the project&#39;s economic landscape through comparative market benchmarking, disclosed cost structures, and analysis of financial mechanisms including Enova grants and green financing\.

The analysis confirms that the project challenges the prevailing industry assumption that high\-ambition sustainability carries a prohibitive &quot;green premium\.&quot; Frydenbø Eiendom projects that Føniks will be realized at a lower total cost than the alternative of demolition and new construction\.3 This is achieved by offsetting high labor and logistical intensities with the acquisition of &quot;free&quot; or low\-cost donor materials, effectively trading material procurement costs for specialized labor costs\.

Furthermore, the project leverages a sophisticated financing stack involving DNB’s Green Loan framework and public support from Enova and Vestland County Council, optimizing the Weighted Average Cost of Capital \(WACC\)\. Operational expenditure \(OPEX\) is projected to decrease significantly through a 50% reduction in energy consumption 1, driven by sea\-water based heating&#x2F;cooling and AI\-driven building management systems\.

## **1\. Introduction and Strategic Context**

### **1\.1 The Imperative for Circular Real Estate**

The Norwegian construction and real estate sector stands at a critical juncture\. Traditionally responsible for approximately 40% of energy consumption and a significant portion of waste generation, the industry is under increasing pressure from both regulatory bodies \(EU Taxonomy, TEK17\) and financial institutions to decarbonize\. &quot;Prosjekt Føniks&quot; emerges in this context not merely as a renovation but as an industrial testbed—a &quot;pilot project&quot; designed to stress\-test the limits of circular economics in a commercial setting\.2

Located in the Damsgård area of Bergen, the project is part of a broader urban transformation strategy managed by Frydenbø Eiendom\. The developer controls a significant portfolio in the area \(approximately 150,000 square meters total portfolio\), allowing Føniks to serve as a strategic R&amp;D asset where lessons learned can be scaled across future developments\.2

### **1\.2 Asset Profile: Damsgårdsveien 127**

The subject asset is a commercial office building of approximately 2,000 square meters \(Gross Floor Area \- GFA\)\.3 Structurally, it consists of a robust concrete column\-and\-slab chassis, a typology common in mid\-to\-late 20th\-century commercial architecture\. This structural resilience makes it an ideal candidate for deep rehabilitation rather than demolition\.3

Historically, the asset suffered from poor urban integration\. A parking structure was positioned tightly against the facade, severing the building&#39;s relationship with the street level and the waterfront\. The architectural vision, led by Artec, involves &quot;freeing&quot; the building from this parking infrastructure, activating the ground floor for commercial&#x2F;public use, and re\-skinning the facade to meet modern aesthetic and thermal standards\.2

### **1\.3 The &quot;100% Reuse&quot; Mandate**

The defining characteristic of Føniks is its radical ambition: to approach 100% reuse of materials\. This is distinct from standard &quot;green&quot; buildings which might focus solely on energy efficiency or sustainable *new* materials \(e\.g\., mass timber\)\. Føniks prioritizes the retention of existing resources and the importation of used components from &quot;donor buildings&quot;\.1

This mandate encompasses:

- **Structural Elements:** Preservation of the concrete skeleton and reuse of cut concrete slabs \(&quot;BetongLego&quot;\)\.4
- **Technical Installations:** Sourcing used ventilation ducts, cable bridges, and sprinkler pipes\.2
- **Building Envelope:** Utilization of windows and facade plates from other demolition sites\.5
- **Vertical Transportation:** Installation of a used elevator, a complex regulatory feat\.2
- **Interiors:** Reuse of glass partition walls, doors, and sanitary ware \(toilets, sinks\)\.5

## **2\. Investment Analysis and Budgetary Reconstruction**

### **2\.1 The Economics of &quot;Cheaper than New Build&quot;**

A central claim from Frydenbø Eiendom is that Føniks is calculated to be realized at a lower cost than demolishing the existing structure and building a new equivalent asset\.3 To validate this claim, we must dissect the cost structure of commercial real estate development in Norway\.

### **2\.1\.1 Benchmark Costs for New Construction**

According to 2024 industry data, the cost of erecting a new commercial office building in Norway \(high standard\) typically ranges between NOK 40,000 and NOK 50,000 per square meter \(including VAT and share of basement&#x2F;parking costs\)\.8

For a 2,000 square meter facility, a new build scenario implies a total investment of:

- **Lower Bound \(40k&#x2F;m²\):** NOK 80 million
- **Upper Bound \(50k&#x2F;m²\):** NOK 100 million

The cost distribution in a new build is heavily weighted towards the physical &quot;building body&quot; \(materials and structure\), which typically accounts for ~44% of costs\.8 Technical disciplines \(VVS&#x2F;Electro\) and common costs \(rig and drift\) make up the remainder\.

### **2\.1\.2 Benchmark Costs for Rehabilitation**

Standard total rehabilitation costs generally fall in the range of NOK 20,000 to NOK 45,000 per square meter, depending on the depth of intervention \(e\.g\., stripping to concrete vs\. cosmetic upgrades\)\.9

- **Total Rehab Estimate:** NOK 40 million – NOK 90 million\.

### **2\.1\.3 The Føniks Cost Model**

Frydenbø’s assertion that Føniks is &quot;rimeligere&quot; \(cheaper\) than a new build places the project&#39;s likely investment budget in the **NOK 50 million to NOK 70 million** range\.3 This represents a strategic &quot;sweet spot&quot;—significantly less capital intensive than a new build \(saving ~30\-40 million NOK\), but likely higher than a basic cosmetic renovation due to the complexity of circular sourcing\.

### **2\.2 Cost Shifting: From Materials to Labor**

The budget composition of Føniks differs fundamentally from standard industry norms \(NS 3451 cost codes\)\. In a circular project, the &quot;Material Cost&quot; line item collapses, while &quot;Labor&quot; and &quot;Consulting&#x2F;Engineering&quot; lines expand\.

**Table 1: Theoretical Cost Shift in Circular Rehabilitation vs\. New Build**

<br>**Cost Category \(NS 3451\)**

**Traditional New Build**

**Circular Project \(Føniks\)**

**Rationale &amp; Mechanism**

**Purchased Materials**

High \(40\-50%\)

**Very Low \(&lt;10%\)**

Sourcing from donor sites \(TV2, Tinghuset\) replaces procurement\.5

**Demolition&#x2F;Waste**

Moderate

**Low**

Deconstruction allows onsite reuse; reduced landfill fees\.4

**Logistics &amp; Transport**

Recertification of used parts \(elevators, concrete\) requires extensive analysis\.2

**Total CAPEX**

**Benchmark \(100%\)**

**90\-95% of Benchmark**

Net result is a total cost savings despite complexity\.5

### **2\.3 The Economics of Donor Materials**

The project&#39;s viability relies on a network of &quot;donor buildings\.&quot; Sourcing materials that would otherwise be waste essentially means the acquisition cost is near zero, or negative \(if the donor pays for removal\)\. However, the &quot;installed cost&quot; is significant\.

- **Case Study: Ventilation Ducts:** Ducts sourced from the TV2 building in Bergen\.5
- *Traditional Cost:* Purchase new steel ducts \+ delivery\.
- *Føniks Cost:* De\-install from TV2 \+ Transport \+ **Manual Washing&#x2F;Cleaning** \+ Reshaping&#x2F;Dent Repair \+ Installation\.5
- *Implication:* The budget trades global steel prices for local labor rates\. This supports the local economy but introduces variability in quality control\.
- **Case Study: Windows:**
- Windows were sourced from a 2018 project in Oslo and a 2022 project, transported via rail\.7
- *Cost Driver:* Logistics and compatibility\. &quot;Almost all windows are different&quot;\.7 This requires the architect \(Artec\) to design the facade *around* the available inventory, rather than specifying windows to fit a design\. This &quot;resource\-based design&quot; process increases architectural hours but eliminates the high cost of new high\-performance glazing\.
- **Case Study: The Used Elevator:**
- Sourcing a used elevator \(potentially from Greece or domestic sources\) is highlighted as a unique challenge\.2
- *Regulatory Cost:* Elevators are safety\-critical systems\. Re\-certifying a used lift for public use in a commercial building under current safety codes \(Lift Directive\) incurs significant consulting and inspection costs, likely offsetting the savings on the hardware itself\. The value here is primarily environmental and symbolic \(innovation leadership\) rather than purely financial\.

## **3\. Financing Structure and Grant Mechanisms**

The capital stack for Føniks is optimized through the use of green financing and public grants, which lowers the effective cost of capital and mitigates the risk of R&amp;D\-heavy activities\.

### **3\.1 DNB Green Financing**

Frydenbø Eiendom explicitly cites DNB as a critical partner, utilizing DNB&#39;s Green Loan framework\.5

- **Mechanism:** DNB offers preferential terms \(lower interest rate margins\) for commercial properties that meet specific criteria, such as BREEAM\-NOR &quot;Very Good&quot; or Energy Class A&#x2F;B\.11
- **Føniks Qualification:** The project targets &quot;FutureBuilt Zero&quot; status and aims to be Norway&#39;s first Svanemerket \(Nordic Swan Ecolabel\) rehabilitated office building\.1
- **Financial Impact:** For a project debt facility of ~40\-50 million NOK, a basis point reduction \(e\.g\., 10\-20 bps\) translates to tangible annual savings in debt service, directly improving the project&#39;s Net Operating Income \(NOI\)\.
- **EU Taxonomy:** DNB uses Føniks to benchmark its own Taxonomy reporting\. By aligning with the Taxonomy&#39;s criteria for &quot;Substantial Contribution to Circular Economy,&quot; Frydenbø ensures the asset remains liquid and attractive to institutional investors who have strict ESG mandates\.5

### **3\.2 Enova Funding**

Enova, the Norwegian state enterprise for energy&#x2F;climate support, plays a vital role in de\-risking the energy and technology aspects of the project\.

- **Program Alignment:** While specific grant sums for Føniks are not itemized in the general lists \(which are dominated by industrial hydrogen projects 12\), the project aligns with several active Enova programs:
2. **&quot;Investeringsstøtte bygg&quot; \(Investment Support for Buildings\):** For upgrading existing building mass to high energy standards\. Frydenbø has historically reduced portfolio energy use by 15% with Enova support\.14
3. **&quot;Prosjektering for ombruk&quot; \(Projecting for Reuse\):** In 2024, Enova granted 8\.6 MNOK across 18 projects for reuse engineering\.15 It is highly probable Føniks received funding under this or the &quot;Mulighetsstudie&quot; \(Feasibility Study\) program during its pre\-project phase to cover the extra costs of consulting engineers \(Skala, Artec\)\.2
4. **New Technology Piloting:** The advanced energy systems \(sea water heat, solar\) and the concrete reuse pilot could qualify for technology diffusion grants\.

### **3\.3 Regional Innovation Support \(Vestland Fylkeskommune\)**

The &quot;BetongLego&quot; initiative—cutting parking decks into reusable blocks—is a spin\-off innovation from the Føniks mindset\. This specific sub\-project involves Rockslice AS and has received financial backing from **Vestland County Council**\.4 This demonstrates a layered funding strategy: local funds for waste innovation, national funds \(Enova\) for energy, and private capital \(DNB\) for the asset development\.

## **4\. Operational Economics \(OPEX\) and Lifecycle Analysis**

The investment thesis for Føniks extends beyond the construction phase into the 60\-year operational lifecycle of the asset\. The shift to a &quot;high\-performance reused&quot; building creates a unique OPEX profile\.

### **4\.1 Energy Cost Reduction**

Energy is the single largest controllable line item in commercial real estate OPEX\. Føniks targets a **50% reduction in energy consumption** compared to the pre\-rehab baseline\.1

- **Technologies:**
- **Sea Water Heating&#x2F;Cooling:** The building connects to a district energy loop sharing sea water thermal energy with neighboring Frydenbø properties\.2 This provides high Coefficient of Performance \(COP\) heating and free cooling, drastically undercutting the cost of electric heating or standalone chillers\.
- **Solar Power:** Roof\-mounted PV panels offset grid purchasing\.2
- **Smart Management:** Deployment of &quot;Adaptic&quot; and &quot;Airthings&quot; sensors allows for demand\-controlled ventilation and heating, preventing energy waste in unoccupied zones\.1
- **Financial Impact:** In the volatile NO5 \(West Norway\) electricity price zone, a 50% cut in kWh&#x2F;m²&#x2F;year creates a robust buffer against energy inflation\. This reduces &quot;Felleskostnader&quot; \(common costs\) for tenants, making the building more competitive in the rental market\.

### **4\.2 Material Lifecycle and Maintenance Risks**

A common financial objection to reuse is the potential for higher maintenance costs \(shorter Remaining Useful Life \- RUL\)\. Frydenbø addresses this through selective sourcing:

- **Verified Quality:** Sourcing windows from 2018&#x2F;2022 means these components are effectively new in terms of their lifecycle curve, retaining 20\+ years of RUL\.7
- **Modular Maintenance:** The use of demountable system walls and accessible technical shafts \(standard in modern offices\) ensures that if a used component fails, it can be replaced without invasive demolition\.
- **Risk Mitigation:** The complexity of warranties on used goods is managed by internalizing the risk or negotiating specific terms with contractors\. As a long\-term owner\-operator \(not a merchant developer building to sell immediately\), Frydenbø is incentivized to accept slightly higher maintenance risks in exchange for lower upfront CAPEX and marketing benefits\.

## **5\. Technological and Logistical Infrastructure**

The &quot;hidden budget&quot; of Føniks lies in its digital and physical logistics\. Achieving circularity requires infrastructure that does not exist in the traditional linear supply chain\.

### **5\.1 Loopfront: The Digital Ledger**

Frydenbø utilizes **Loopfront**, a digital platform for material mapping, to manage the complex inventory of used assets\.2

- **Investment:** Using Loopfront requires upfront labor investment to survey, photograph, quantify, and tag \(QR code\) thousands of objects\.7 2,600 elements were registered\.
- **Return:** This digitization creates visibility\. It allows architects to design *with* available stock and enables the transfer of surplus materials between different buildings in Frydenbø&#39;s 150,000 m² portfolio\.2 This reduces waste disposal costs and new purchasing costs across the wider company, not just the Føniks project\.

### **5\.2 The Logistics of &quot;Urban Mining&quot;**

The project reveals the logistical friction of circularity\.

- **Storage:** Unlike &quot;Just\-in\-Time&quot; delivery from a factory, reuse requires &quot;Just\-in\-Case&quot; storage\. Frydenbø utilizes its own warehouse space to buffer materials \(like glass walls\) until installation\.7 This internalizes a warehousing cost\.
- **Transport:** Sourcing windows from Oslo involved rail transport to Bergen\.7 While rail is low\-carbon, the logistics of coordinating pick\-up from a demolition site in Oslo \(Ombygg at Økern\) to a train, and then to the site in Bergen, creates a complex management overhead compared to ordering a standard delivery from a supplier\.

### **5\.3 Concrete Reuse: The &quot;BetongLego&quot; Pilot**

Perhaps the most capital\-intensive innovation is the attempt to reuse structural concrete\. Frydenbø, in partnership with Rockslice, is piloting the cutting of concrete slabs from the parking deck to be used as building blocks\.4

- **Cost vs\. Benefit:** Cutting reinforced concrete is labor and energy\-intensive \(diamond sawing\)\. The economic viability depends on the avoided cost of disposal \(which is high for heavy concrete\) and the avoided cost of pouring new concrete \(which has high CO2 taxes and material costs\)\. Even if cost\-neutral, the CO2 savings are massive, contributing to the &quot;FutureBuilt Zero&quot; certification\.

## **6\. Valuation and Market Exit Strategy**

While Frydenbø is a long\-term holder, the *valuation* of the asset is critical for their balance sheet and borrowing capacity\.

### **6\.1 The &quot;Greenium&quot; \(Green Premium\)**

There is growing evidence in the Norwegian commercial real estate market that certified sustainable buildings command a rental premium \(&quot;Greenium&quot;\) and, more importantly, a **Yield Compression** \(lower yield = higher value\)\.11

- **Tenant Demand:** High\-value tenants \(tech, finance, marine\) increasingly require buildings that support their own CSRD \(Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\) obligations\. Føniks, with its extreme sustainability narrative, offers tenants a powerful branding tool\.
- **Yield Impact:** A building compliant with the EU Taxonomy and holding a Svanemerket certification is viewed as a &quot;future\-proofed&quot; asset with lower regulatory risk\. This can compress the yield by 25\-50 basis points compared to a standard &quot;brown&quot; building, significantly increasing the asset&#39;s capital value upon completion\.

### **6\.2 Competitive Positioning in the &quot;Marine Cluster&quot;**

Damsgård is developing into a specialized cluster\. By creating a high\-profile sustainable flagship, Frydenbø enhances the attractiveness of the entire district\. This creates a positive feedback loop: higher district prestige \-&gt; higher rents \-&gt; increased portfolio value\. The shared energy infrastructure \(sea water\) further locks tenants into the ecosystem\.3

## **7\. Environmental Return on Investment \(EROI\)**

The project&#39;s budget effectiveness is also measured in carbon\.

- **Carbon Math:**
- Standard Rehab: \-49% material emissions, \+21% energy emissions \(due to inefficiencies\) = \-11% Total\.
- **Prosjekt Føniks:** \-89% material emissions \(reuse\), \-15% energy emissions \(sea water&#x2F;solar\) = **\-51% Total Climate Footprint**\.2
- **Implication:** This massive reduction positions Føniks as a &quot;Paris\-proof&quot; asset, insulating it from future carbon taxes which are expected to rise significantly in Norway towards 2030\.

## **8\. Conclusion**

Prosjekt Føniks challenges the orthodoxy that sustainable construction is inherently more expensive\. By replacing the purchase of new materials with the labor of rehabilitating old ones, Frydenbø Eiendom has structured a budget that is projected to be lower than a comparable new build\.3

**Key Financial Takeaways:**

1. **CAPEX Efficiency:** Total investment is estimated in the **50\-70 MNOK range**, undercutting the 80\-100 MNOK benchmark for new construction\.
2. **Cost Redistribution:** The project shifts capital flows from global material manufacturers to local labor and logistics providers\.
3. **Subsidized Risk:** The technical and logistical risks of this &quot;pilot&quot; approach are heavily mitigated by Enova grants, Vestland regional support, and favorable DNB Green Loan terms\.
4. **Operational Value:** A 50% energy reduction creates a high\-NOI asset with low exposure to energy market volatility\.

Ultimately, Føniks serves as a proof\-of\-concept that with digital inventory management \(Loopfront\), a collaborative supply chain \(donor buildings\), and a supportive financial ecosystem, the circular economy is not just an environmental imperative but a viable financial strategy for commercial real estate in Norway\.
