# Economic and Operational Feasibility of Circular Rehabilitation: A Comprehensive Analysis of Kristian Augusts Gate 23 \(KA23\)

## **1\. Executive Introduction and Strategic Context**

The rehabilitation of Kristian Augusts gate 23 \(KA23\) in Oslo stands as a seminal project in the Nordic construction sector&#39;s transition toward a circular economy\. Owned by Höegh Eiendom and executed with Seltor as the total contractor, the project represents the first instance in Norway where a heritage\-protected building has been rehabilitated strictly according to circular principles\.1 This report provides an exhaustive financial and operational analysis of the project, dissecting the cost structures, economic incentives, and systemic barriers encountered during its execution from 2020 to 2022\.

The project is situated within the broader transformation of the Tullinløkka district, a strategic urban renewal initiative in Oslo that has become a laboratory for sustainable innovation\. KA23, a 1950s modernist structure originally designed by Bjercke &amp; Eliassen as the headquarters for the Norwegian Employers&#39; Confederation \(NAF\), was identified not merely as a rehabilitation target but as a pilot for the FutureBuilt program&#39;s circular criteria\.3 The project&#39;s ambition was to achieve a minimum 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to a standard reference building, a goal it exceeded significantly by achieving an 83% reduction in &quot;as built&quot; emissions\.3

However, the economic reality of such pioneering work is complex\. The transition from a linear &quot;take\-make\-waste&quot; model to a circular &quot;map\-dismantle\-reuse&quot; model introduces profound shifts in the cost structure of construction\. Labor costs replace material costs; logistics management replaces procurement simplicity; and risk management becomes a dominant financial driver\. The project saw its contract value escalate from an initial 187 MNOK to a final settlement of approximately 220 MNOK 5, a variance that encapsulates the &quot;innovation premium&quot; currently required to drive circularity in a market optimized for linearity\.

This report synthesizes data from project\-specific environmental accounts, contractor financial disclosures, and the integrated learning reports from the &quot;Tullin Cluster&quot; \(comprising KA23 and its neighbor KA13\)\. It specifically addresses the comparative costs of reused versus new materials, the operational expenditures \(OPEX\) associated with mapping and dismantling, the quantified savings achieved, and the role of public financial instruments like Enova and Klimasats in de\-risking the venture\.

### **1\.1 The Circular Mandate and Asset Strategy**

Höegh Eiendom’s decision to pursue a radical reuse strategy for KA23 was driven by a convergence of regulatory foresight, corporate sustainability targets, and long\-term asset value preservation\. As a family\-owned real estate company with a portfolio value of approximately 9\.6 billion NOK \(2024\) 7, Höegh Eiendom views the &quot;green premium&quot;—the potential for higher rents and lower yields on certified sustainable assets—as a core component of its investment thesis\.

The project was mandated to follow FutureBuilt’s criteria for circular buildings, which imposed strict requirements on material loops\. Specifically, the project aimed for at least 50% reuse of materials and components\. This necessitated a complete rethinking of the supply chain\. Instead of ordering standardized components from a catalog, the project team, including architects Arcasa and engineers Multiconsult, had to &quot;harvest&quot; the existing building\. The result was an internal reuse rate of 83% 3, meaning the vast majority of the building&#39;s mass was preserved in situ or repurposed within the structure\.

The strategic importance of this lies in the &quot;carbon economy\.&quot; With the real estate sector responsible for 40% of global emissions and raw material extraction, regulatory pressure is mounting in the form of the EU Taxonomy and potential future carbon taxes\. By achieving an 83% reduction in emissions, KA23 effectively &quot;pre\-paid&quot; its carbon liability, insulating the asset from future regulatory costs and aligning it with the strictest green bond criteria\.3

### **1\.2 The &quot;Tullin Cluster&quot; Synergy**

A critical factor in the economic analysis of KA23 is its relationship with Kristian Augusts gate 13 \(KA13\), a neighboring project developed by Entra\. These two projects operated as a &quot;circular cluster,&quot; sharing not just knowledge but physical materials\. This proximity allowed for a micro\-market of reuse to emerge, drastically reducing the transport costs that typically kill the business case for reusing heavy, low\-value materials\. For example, KA23 donated 165 square meters of ceiling plates and 70 linear meters of cable channels to KA13\.3 Conversely, elements that could not be used in KA13 were assessed for KA23\.

This inter\-project collaboration highlights a key economic finding: the viability of circularity is geographically sensitive\. Reuse becomes exponentially more profitable when the distance between donor and recipient approaches zero, eliminating logistics costs and reducing the carbon footprint of transport\.3

## **2\. Financial Architecture and Contractual Dynamics**

The financial structure of the KA23 project reflects the inherent uncertainties of deep rehabilitation\. Unlike new builds, where quantities and specifications can be fixed early, a circular rehabilitation is a process of discovery\.

### **2\.1 Contract Value and Cost Escalation**

The primary financial instrument for the construction phase was a total contract \(totalentreprise\) awarded to Seltor AS\.

- **Initial Contract Sum:** 187 MNOK \(excl\. VAT\)\.5
- **Final Contract Sum:** ~220 MNOK \(excl\. VAT\)\.5
- **Variance:** ~33 MNOK \(\+17\.6%\)\.

This escalation of nearly 18% is significant and merits detailed decomposition\. While standard construction projects often include a contingency for change orders \(typically 5\-10%\), the higher variance in KA23 can be attributed to several specific factors identified in the research:

1. **The &quot;Discovery&quot; Phase:** In a circular project, the building itself is the material bank\. However, the quality of this bank is often unknown until dismantling begins\. Unforeseen structural conditions or materials containing hazardous substances \(requiring sanitization rather than reuse\) lead to change orders\.6
2. **Pilot Inefficiencies:** As a pilot project, KA23 bore the cost of &quot;first\-time&quot; processes\. The report notes that costs were higher than expected &quot;since this was the first time,&quot; with a clear expectation that subsequent projects would benefit from established routines and lower costs\.3
3. **Process Innovation:** The project required the development of new methods for dismantling, testing, and verifying materials\. These are R&amp;D\-like activities that were billed to the project budget rather than amortized across a product line as they would be in manufacturing\.9

Despite this cost increase, the project remained commercially viable for Höegh Eiendom, supported by strong leasing markets and the high asset value of a modernized, centrally located heritage building\. The gross area of the project was approximately 8,730 square meters 5, placing the final rehabilitation cost at roughly 25,200 NOK per square meter\. In the context of Oslo&#39;s prime office market, where new build costs can exceed 30,000\-40,000 NOK&#x2F;m² \(excluding land\), this remains a competitive figure, particularly given the preservation of the structural shell which avoided the massive costs of groundworks and concrete framing\.

### **2\.2 Public Funding and Support Mechanisms**

To offset the &quot;innovation risk,&quot; KA23 utilized available public support mechanisms\. While there is a misconception that circular projects are heavily subsidized, the direct financial support was targeted and relatively modest compared to the total CAPEX\.

### **2\.2\.1 Enova Support for Energy Measures**

The state enterprise Enova provided direct financial support to the project\.

- **Grant Amount:** 1\.5 MNOK\.10
- **Scope:** The funding was strictly tied to energy efficiency measures, not reuse per se\. Supported measures included:
- High\-performance window glass \(upgrading existing frames or new efficient units\)\.
- Room regulation systems \(smart controls\)\.
- VAV \(Variable Air Volume\) ventilation control\.
- Flow\-regulated heating systems\.
- Thermal insulation improvements to the roof\.3

**Analysis of Enova Support:** The 1\.5 MNOK represents approximately 0\.68% of the final contract value\. This indicates that the circular strategy was *not* dependent on subsidies for its core viability\. Instead, the Enova grant acted as a &quot;top\-up&quot; to incentivize the push toward Near Zero Energy Building \(nZEB\) standards in a heritage structure where thermal improvements are technically difficult and expensive\.3

### **2\.2\.2 Klimasats and FutureBuilt**

The project also benefited from broader programmatic support through Klimasats, a fund managed by the Norwegian Environment Agency\.

- **Program Grant:** 3 MNOK was granted to FutureBuilt to facilitate three specific circular pilots: KA13, KA23, and Skur 38\.11
- **Impact:** This funding did not go to the developer&#39;s bottom line but supported the *process*—paying for the specialized consulting, research, and documentation required by FutureBuilt\. This &quot;soft support&quot; is crucial in reducing the barrier to entry, as the administrative burden of documenting circularity \(e\.g\., creating material passports, performing lifecycle analyses\) is currently a significant unrecoverable cost\.11

## **3\. The Economics of Reuse: Comparative Cost Analysis**

A central requirement of this investigation is the comparison of costs between reused materials and new alternatives\. Data from the Tullin cluster \(KA23 and KA13\) provides a granular view of this economic landscape\. The data reveals a bifurcated economy: &quot;Industrial&quot; materials \(steel, concrete\) are currently significantly more expensive to reuse, while &quot;Technical&quot; and &quot;Finish&quot; materials \(windows, HVAC\) can offer substantial savings\.

### **3\.1 Structural Materials: The High Cost of Heavy Reuse**

The most counter\-intuitive finding for many observers is that reusing raw structural materials is expensive\. This is driven by the &quot;reverse logistics&quot; penalty—the cost of undoing the efficiency of the linear economy\.

### **3\.1\.1 Hollow Core Slabs \(Hulldekker\)**

- **Cost of Reuse:** Estimated at **5\-6 times** the price of new elements\.9
- **Cost Drivers:**
- *Transport:* Transport accounts for up to 90% of the CO2 emissions and a massive portion of the cost\. Concrete is heavy and low\-value\. Moving it from a donor building to a storage site and then to KA23 incurs double handling costs\.13
- *Dismantling:* Sawing out concrete slabs without damaging them is slow, labor\-intensive work compared to rapid demolition\.9
- *Testing:* Every reused slab must be certified for load\-bearing capacity, requiring engineering hours that new, standardized slabs do not need\.
- **Context:** For KA23, the primary strategy was *retention* \(keeping slabs in place\) rather than *importing* used slabs\. Retention is cost\-effective; importing used slabs is currently a loss\-leader done for environmental certification\.3

### **3\.1\.2 Structural Steel**

- **Cost of Reuse:** ~100 NOK&#x2F;kg\.9
- **Cost of New:** ~67 NOK&#x2F;kg\.9
- **Variance:** Reuse is **~49% more expensive**\.
- **Cost Drivers:** Used steel requires &quot;de\-coating&quot; \(removing old fire paint or lead paint\), non\-destructive testing \(NDT\) to check for micro\-cracks, and re\-fabrication to fit new dimensions\. The labor cost of these steps in Norway currently exceeds the commodity price of new steel\.9

### **3\.2 Technical and Façade Elements: The Savings Opportunity**

In contrast to basic structural materials, complex manufactured components showed significant economic potential for reuse\.

### **3\.2\.1 Windows \(Vinduer\)**

- **Small Windows \(1\.6x1\.5m\):**
- Reuse Cost: ~6,017 NOK&#x2F;unit\.
- New Cost: ~14,414 NOK&#x2F;unit\.
- **Savings:** **~59%**\.13
- **Large Windows \(1\.6x2\.2m\):**
- Reuse Cost: ~8,336 NOK&#x2F;unit\.
- New Cost: ~21,195 NOK&#x2F;unit\.
- **Savings:** **~61%**\.13
- **Analysis:** Windows are high\-value manufactured goods\. The labor required to carefully remove, clean, and re\-install them is significantly less than the purchase price of a new, high\-performance unit\. However, this assumes the existing windows meet thermal standards or can be upgraded cost\-effectively\. In KA23, Enova support helped upgrade glazing while retaining frames, maximizing this value\.3

### **3\.2\.2 Chilled Beams \(Kjølebafler\)**

- **Reuse Cost:** ~1,840 NOK&#x2F;unit\.
- **New Cost:** ~5,405 NOK&#x2F;unit\.
- **Savings:** **~66%**\.9
- **Analysis:** This represents the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; of circularity\. 138 units were mapped and reused\. HVAC components have high embodied carbon \(metals, copper\) and high sticker prices\. Testing them for leaks is relatively cheap\. The 66% saving here is a direct contribution to the project&#39;s bottom line, helping to offset the premiums on structural reuse\.9

### **3\.2\.3 Ceiling Tiles \(Himlingsplater\)**

- **Reuse Cost:** ~228 NOK&#x2F;m²\.
- **New Cost:** ~140 NOK&#x2F;m²\.
- **Variance:** Reuse is **~63% more expensive**\.9
- **Analysis:** Unlike windows, ceiling tiles are a low\-margin commodity product\. The labor to sort, clean, and restack them makes them more expensive than buying new mass\-produced tiles\. However, KA23 still pursued this for environmental credits, and even donated excess tiles to KA13 to avoid waste fees, changing the economic calculation from &quot;procurement cost&quot; to &quot;total waste management cost&quot;\.3

### **3\.3 The Brick Economy \(Tegl\) and Waste Avoidance**

A headline figure for the project was the management of brick\.

- **Volume:** 325 tons of brick \(approximately 140,000 \- 150,000 bricks depending on type\)\.3
- **Destination:** Delivered to Østfoldgress \(a landscaping&#x2F;turf entity\)\.3
- **Economic Mechanism:** This transaction appears to be a &quot;donation&quot; or cost\-neutral transfer rather than a sale\.
- *Avoided Cost:* If KA23 had sent 325 tons of brick to a landfill or standard recycling \(crushing for road fill\), the gate fees would have been substantial\. By diverting this to Østfoldgress for reuse in landscaping, the project avoided the &quot;waste tax&quot; and gate fees\.
- *Transport Cost:* The project likely bore the cost of palletizing and transport\.
- *Net Result:* Likely a break\-even operation financially, but a massive win for the environmental accounts \(Scope 3 emissions reduction\)\.

## **4\. Operational Cost Drivers: The &quot;Hidden&quot; Costs of Circularity**

Beyond the direct material unit costs, the project report highlights several operational phases that incurred &quot;mercosts&quot; \(additional costs\) compared to a standard linear project\.

### **4\.1 The Cost of Information: Mapping \(Kartlegging\)**

In a linear project, the architect specifies a product, and the contractor buys it\. In a circular project, the team must first find out what they already have\.

- **The Process:** &quot;Ombrukskartlegging&quot; \(reuse mapping\) involves detailed inventories, condition assessments, and digitization of existing assets\.3
- **Cost Implication:** This required thousands of consultant hours early in the project\. KA23 initially lacked a dedicated &quot;Reuse Coordinator,&quot; forcing Höegh’s own project managers to step in\. The report concludes that this was inefficient and that a dedicated role, while an added salary line, would have been net\-positive by streamlining the complex logistics\.3
- **Strategic Insight:** The cost of mapping is the &quot;price of admission&quot; for circularity\. Without it, the resource bank is invisible\.

### **4\.2 Dismantling vs\. Demolition \(Demontering\)**

- **The Difference:** Demolition is destructive and fast \(excavators\)\. Dismantling is constructive and slow \(manual labor\)\.
- **Cost Impact:** For components like cable trays or facade panels, the dismantling cost constituted up to **81%** of the total reuse cost\.9 This extreme labor intensity is the primary barrier in a high\-wage economy like Norway\.
- **Contractual Tension:** Contractors paid on fixed price&#x2F;time bases view dismantling as a schedule risk\. Seltor and Höegh had to collaborate closely to manage the schedule implications of &quot;surgical&quot; removal of materials\.6

### **4\.3 Logistics and Intermediate Storage \(Mellomlagring\)**

- **The Challenge:** Oslo city center has virtually no spare space\. Materials harvested in Month 2 might not be needed until Month 10\.
- **Cost Impact:** Storage costs accounted for ~3% of reuse costs, and transport via storage accounted for ~9%\.9 While these percentages seem low, they add logistical friction\. The &quot;just\-in\-time&quot; delivery model of the construction industry breaks down with reuse\.
- **Mitigation:** The &quot;Tullin Cooperation&quot; between KA23 and KA13 helped mitigate this by allowing some immediate transfers, bypassing the need for external warehousing\.3

### **4\.4 Risk Management and Technical Failures**

Reuse introduces functional risk\.

- **The Automation Incident:** KA23 reused technical equipment \(likely ventilation or actuator components\) but faced &quot;mixed success&quot; due to communication protocols not matching the new automation systems\.3
- **Cost Consequence:** Troubleshooting these compatibility issues required extra hours from electricians and automation engineers, eroding the initial savings of the reused hardware\.
- **Lesson:** Technical reuse requires rigorous compatibility testing *before* installation\. The &quot;savings&quot; on hardware can quickly be consumed by &quot;costs&quot; in software integration\.

## **5\. Environmental Savings and Value Creation**

While the financial spreadsheet shows mixed results \(savings in windows&#x2F;HVAC vs\. premiums in structure\), the environmental spreadsheet is unequivocally positive\.

### **5\.1 Carbon Savings**

- **Total Reduction:** 83% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions &quot;as built&quot; compared to reference\.3
- **Material Breakdown:** The reuse of the concrete hull and the retention of the facade prevented the massive carbon spike associated with pouring new concrete and smelting new aluminum&#x2F;steel\.
- **Monetization:** While carbon is not yet taxed at a level that offsets the labor costs of reuse \(e\.g\., 2000\+ NOK&#x2F;ton\), this reduction future\-proofs the asset against the inevitable introduction of stricter carbon pricing in the EU&#x2F;EEA\.

### **5\.2 Tenant Value and Market Position**

Höegh Eiendom reported a strong leasing market response\.

- **Tenants:** The building attracted high\-profile tenants Dentsu Norge and Simula Research Laboratory\.14
- **Value Proposition:** These tenants have their own ESG reporting requirements\. Moving into a &quot;climate winner&quot; building like KA23 helps them meet their own Scope 3 reduction targets\.
- **Rent Premium:** While specific rent rolls are confidential, Höegh’s annual reports indicate &quot;historically low vacancy&quot; \(5% portfolio\-wide, 3% in Oslo\) and increased rental income \(\+20% in 2023\), partly driven by the high quality of the sustainable portfolio\.15 The &quot;story&quot; of KA23 allows the landlord to compete for the most solvent, forward\-looking tenants\.

### **5\.3 BREEAM and Taxonomy Alignment**

The project is certified BREEAM In\-Use &quot;Excellent&quot;\.3 In the current financial market, banks offer &quot;Green Loans&quot; with lower interest margins \(basis points\) for certified assets\. For a company with 9\.6 billion NOK in assets and 3\.4 billion in equity 7, a reduction in financing costs across the portfolio due to green credentials represents a significant annual saving that operates at the corporate level, distinct from the project budget\.

## **6\. Synthesis: The Economics of the &quot;First Mover&quot;**

KA23 cannot be evaluated solely as a standalone P&amp;L exercise\. It was a strategic R&amp;D project for Höegh Eiendom, Seltor, and the Norwegian industry\.

### **6\.1 The Pilot Premium**

The increase in contract value from 187 MNOK to 220 MNOK should be viewed as a &quot;Pilot Premium\.&quot;

- **Cost of Learning:** The project team had to invent the supply chain\. They lacked the &quot;Finn\.no for construction materials&quot; that is now emerging\. They had to manually source, test, and certify\.
- **Future Reductions:** The report explicitly states that &quot;costs were higher than they will be in the next project&quot;\.3 The protocols developed for KA23 \(e\.g\., how to test old concrete\) are now intellectual property that lowers the cost for future projects like the &quot;Wernergården&quot; \(Kirkegata 20\), which aims for 60% circularity\.16

## **7\. Conclusion**

The rehabilitation of Kristian Augusts gate 23 proves that circular construction is operationally feasible and environmentally superior, though it currently carries a financial premium for structural elements\.

**Addressing the User&#39;s Specific Needs:**

1. **Cost of Reuse vs\. New:** The data shows a split economy\. Technical and high\-value manufactured components \(Windows, HVAC\) offered **savings of ~60%**\. Low\-value, heavy materials \(Concrete, Steel, Ceiling tiles\) incurred **premiums of 49% to 500%** due to the high cost of Norwegian labor and logistics relative to standardized new production\.
2. **Additional Costs \(Kartlegging&#x2F;Demontering\):** These &quot;soft costs&quot; and &quot;process costs&quot; were significant drivers of the budget increase \(187 MNOK \-&gt; 220 MNOK\)\. Dismantling can cost nearly as much as the component&#39;s value, and mapping requires front\-loaded investment\.
3. **Savings \(Besparelser\):** Direct monetary savings were realized in specific sub\-contracts \(HVAC, Windows\), but the macro\-saving was in the **avoided carbon tax liability** \(theoretical\) and the **avoided waste fees** \(brick\)\. The project also secured 1\.5 MNOK in operational support\.
4. **Support \(FutureBuilt&#x2F;Klimasats\):** The project received **1\.5 MNOK directly from Enova** for energy measures\. It benefitted indirectly from **3 MNOK in Klimasats funding** allocated to FutureBuilt to manage the pilot process\.

**Final Verdict:** KA23 was a &quot;loss leader&quot; on specific material lines \(like steel and concrete reuse\) to secure a &quot;market leader&quot; position for the asset and the owner\. The 33 MNOK budget variance was the investment required to unlock the long\-term value of a green, BREEAM\-certified heritage asset that commands premium rents and attractive financing\. For the industry, KA23 demonstrates that the path to profitability in circularity lies in **industrializing the reverse logistics**—automating the testing, cleaning, and certification processes that currently rely on expensive manual labor\.
