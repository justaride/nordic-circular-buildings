# Comprehensive Project Analysis: Løren Activity Park and Multi\-Purpose Hall

## **1\. Executive Summary**

The ongoing transformation of Løren from a peripheral industrial zone into one of Oslo&#39;s most densely populated residential districts has necessitated a strategic recalibration of social infrastructure\. The **Løren Activity Park and Multi\-Purpose Hall** \(*Løren aktivitetspark og flerbrukshall*\) stands as a flagship project within this urban renewal effort\. Commissioned by **Oslobygg KF**, the project is designed not merely as a sports facility but as a critical node in &quot;Den Grønne Ringen&quot; \(The Green Ring\)—a planned recreational corridor connecting the disparate neighborhoods of Hovinbyen\.

This report provides an exhaustive identification and analysis of the project team, extending beyond the client and architect to encompass the entire engineering, environmental, and construction consortium\. While the user&#39;s initial premise correctly identifies the Client \(*Byggherre*\) as Oslobygg KF, a critical distinction regarding the Architect is required: **PIR2 Arkitekter** is the design and landscape architect for the building and park, while **LPO Arkitekter** served as the expert consultant for the zoning and regulatory planning of the wider area\.

The research has successfully identified the missing project partners requested:

- **Structural Engineer \(RIB\):** Pro Consult \(System &amp; BIM\) and Stabil \(Steel\)\.
- **HVAC Engineer \(RIV\):** Structor \(Consulting\) and Energima \(Contractor\)\.
- **Electrical Engineer \(RIE\):** Fremst \(Consulting\) and Torshov Elektro \(Contractor\)\.
- **Environmental Consultant \(Miljørådgiver\):** Rambøll\.
- **General Contractor \(Entreprenør\):** Håndverkskompaniet AS\.

Beyond these core roles, this report details the involvement of specialized niche consultants, including **Intec Norge** \(Fire Safety\), **Paya Solutions** \(Geotechnics\), and **WSP** \(Acoustics\), as well as the innovative supply chain partners facilitating the project&#39;s pioneering circular economy initiatives—most notably the reuse of offshore steel from the decommissioned *Curlew FPSO*\.

## **2\. Introduction: Urban Context and Project Imperatives**

### **2\.1 The Transformation of Løren and Hovinbyen**

To understand the technical complexity and the specific team selection for this project, one must first appreciate the urban context of Løren\. Historically defined by light industry, logistics, and military infrastructure, Løren has undergone a radical densification over the past two decades\. This shift aligns with the &quot;Fjord City&quot; and &quot;Hovinbyen&quot; strategies of Oslo Municipality, which aim to accommodate population growth through inward expansion rather than urban sprawl\.

However, the rapid pace of residential construction initially outstripped the development of public amenities\. By the late 2010s, Løren was characterized by high\-density housing blocks but lacked sufficient &quot;third places&quot;—social infrastructures where community life occurs outside the home and workplace\. The Løren Activity Park and Multi\-Purpose Hall was conceived to bridge this gap\. It is not an isolated building but a piece of landscape infrastructure\.1

### **2\.2 The &quot;Green Ring&quot; Strategy**

The project is geographically and strategically situated on &quot;Den Grønne Ringen&quot; \(The Green Ring\)\. This municipal master plan envisions a continuous 6\.5\-kilometer recreational route linking Løren, Økern, and other parts of Hovinbyen\. The implication for the project team was profound: the building could not turn its back on the city\. It had to be permeable, accessible, and visually integrated into a park setting\.

This requirement drove the architectural decision to submerge the multi\-purpose hall partially underground\.1 By lowering the building&#39;s volume, the roofscape becomes an extension of the park, effectively doubling the site&#39;s utility\. This &quot;active roof&quot; concept, while urbanistically brilliant, introduced significant engineering challenges—specifically regarding load\-bearing capacity, water\-proofing, and vibration control—which necessitated a highly specialized engineering team \(RIB\) capable of managing dynamic loads on long\-span roof structures\.2

### **2\.3 Project Scope and Functional Requirements**

The facility is a hybrid structure comprising:

- **The Multi\-Purpose Hall:** A 2,500 square meter indoor facility featuring a 16x24 meter playing surface optimized for volleyball, badminton, and mini\-handball\. It includes specialized zones for dance, martial arts, and strength training, reflecting a shift in municipal sports planning from mono\-functional competitive arenas to multi\-use activity centers\.2
- **The Activity Park:** A 6,000 to 7,000 square meter outdoor area designed for unorganized sports\. It includes street basketball courts, climbing structures, and social zones\. Crucially, a significant portion of this park rests on the roof of the hall, requiring seamless integration between landscape architecture and structural engineering\.2

## **3\. The Client: Oslobygg KF and the Procurement Strategy**

### **3\.1 The Organization: Oslobygg KF**

The developer and client for the project is **Oslobygg KF**\.4 This municipal enterprise is a relatively new giant in the Norwegian construction sector, formed through the merger of *Omsorgsbygg*, *Undervisningsbygg*, *Kultur\- og idrettsbygg*, and the development section of *Boligbygg*\.

The creation of Oslobygg KF was driven by a desire to professionalize public procurement and to use the municipality&#39;s purchasing power to drive market innovation\. For the Løren project, this mandate is visible in the strict environmental requirements imposed on the tenderers\. Oslobygg acts not just as a payer of bills but as a normative actor, setting standards for fossil\-free construction sites and circular material use that exceed national building codes\.1

### **3\.2 The Tender Process: Value Over Cost**

The selection of the project team was the result of a rigorous public tender process concluded in early 2023\. A critical insight into Oslobygg&#39;s strategy is found in the weighting of the award criteria\. Unlike traditional public tenders where price often dictates 70\-80% of the decision, the Løren tender utilized the following split:

- **Price:** 50%
- **Quality:** 30%
- **Environment:** 20%

This distribution had a tangible impact on the outcome\. **Håndverkskompaniet AS** was awarded the contract despite *not* being the lowest bidder\. A competing firm, Ruta Entreprenør, submitted a bid approximately 1\.2 million NOK lower than Håndverkskompaniet’s 161 million NOK offer\. However, Håndverkskompaniet secured the project by scoring higher on the &quot;Quality&quot; and &quot;Environment&quot; parameters\.5

This decision underscores the complexity of the project\. The client recognized that the risks associated with the semi\-subterranean construction, the high\-tech Passive House requirements, and the ambitious material reuse pilots required a contractor with superior management systems, even if it came at a slight premium\.

### **3\.3 The Field of Competitors**

The attractiveness of the Løren project is evidenced by the high number of bidders\. Thirteen major contracting firms competed for the role of *Totalentreprenør*, indicating a highly competitive market for public infrastructure projects in Oslo\. The competitors included:

- Asker Entreprenør
- Askim Entreprenør
- Betongarbeider
- HAB Constructions
- J\.I\. Bygg
- Klima og Bygg
- Moderne Byggfornyelse
- Peab \(A Nordic giant, notable that they did not win\)
- Ruta Entreprenør \(Lowest price, but lost on quality&#x2F;environment\)
- SEBY
- WK Entreprenør 5

## **4\. Architectural Leadership: Clarifying the Roles**

A significant point of confusion in the user&#39;s request involves the identity of the Architect\. The user states &quot;Arkitekt \(LPO Arkitekter\),&quot; but the research material explicitly contradicts this for the building itself\.

### **4\.1 The Project Architect: PIR2 Arkitekter**

The design architect and landscape architect for the Løren Activity Park and Multi\-Purpose Hall is **PIR2 Arkitekter**\.2

PIR2 is a firm known for its expertise in landscape\-integrated architecture\. Their specific contribution to this project is the seamless fusion of the building mass with the surrounding terrain\. By designing the hall to be partially submerged, they reduced the visual impact on the neighboring high\-rises and maximized the programmable surface area\. Their scope includes:

- **Architectural Design:** Defining the building envelope, internal spatial organization, and facade aesthetics \(which include sinusoidal plates and reused wood\)\.6
- **Landscape Architecture:** Designing the 6,000\+ square meter park, including the rooftop activity zones, ensuring universal accessibility across steep terrain changes\.1

### **4\.2 The Planning Architect: LPO Arkitekter**

The user&#39;s association of LPO Arkitekter with the project is not unfounded but pertains to a different phase of development\. LPO Arkitekter has been a dominant force in the urban planning of the Løren and Ulven districts\. Research indicates that LPO Arkitekter acted as the **Fagkyndig** \(Expert Consultant\) for the **Reguleringsplan** \(Zoning Plan\) of the area\.7

Additionally, LPO has designed several adjacent residential blocks, such as the *Gregers Kvartal*\.8 In large urban developments, it is common for one firm \(LPO\) to set the &quot;rules of the game&quot; through zoning, while another firm \(PIR2\) wins the specific commission to design a public building within that zone\. Therefore, while LPO set the stage, PIR2 is the author of the play\.

## **5\. The General Contractor: Håndverkskompaniet AS**

### **5\.1 Role and Scope**

**Håndverkskompaniet AS** serves as the **Totalentreprenør** \(Turnkey&#x2F;General Contractor\)\.4 In the Norwegian *Totalentreprise* model \(typically NS 8407\), the General Contractor assumes total responsibility for both the design development \(post\-preliminary design\) and the physical construction\. This places Håndverkskompaniet at the apex of the production hierarchy, managing all subcontractors and technical consultants\.

### **5\.2 Project Execution and Challenges**

The contract, valued at approx\. 161 million NOK \(excl\. VAT\), commenced in May 2023 with a planned completion in Spring 2025\.5 Håndverkskompaniet’s Project Manager, Jon Henie, has highlighted several execution risks that the firm manages:

- **Logistics in a Dense Urban Zone:** The site is surrounded by inhabited residential blocks, requiring strict noise control and traffic management for heavy deliveries\.
- **The Fossil\-Free Site:** Adhering to Oslo Municipality&#39;s requirement that all construction machinery be emission\-free \(electric or biodiesel\) and that transport to&#x2F;from the site be emission\-free by 2025\.3
- **Material Reuse Integration:** Managing the logistics of non\-standard materials, such as the &quot;upcycled&quot; steel from the North Sea and concrete elements from Stig School, which do not arrive with standard factory certifications and require on\-site validation\.1

## **6\. The Engineering Team \(Rådgivergruppen\)**

To satisfy the user&#39;s request for the &quot;missing&quot; team members, this section provides a detailed breakdown of the engineering disciplines\. The data is primarily derived from a comprehensive project fact sheet identified in the research 2, corroborated by cross\-references from other industry news sources\.

### **6\.1 RIB: Structural Engineering \(Rådgivende Ingeniør Bygg\)**

The structural engineering function is split between two firms, reflecting the specialized nature of the hybrid concrete\-steel design\.

- **RIB \(System &amp; BIM\): Pro Consult**\.2
- *Core Responsibilities:* Pro Consult is responsible for the overall structural integrity of the main building\. This involves the design of the cast\-in\-place concrete walls and the hollow\-core slab \(*hulldekke*\) systems\. Their role as BIM \(Building Information Modeling\) Coordinator is critical; they integrate the digital models from the architect, structural, and technical engineers to detect &quot;clashes&quot; \(e\.g\., a ventilation duct hitting a structural beam\) before construction begins\.
- *Specific Challenge:* Anchoring the building to the bedrock and calculating the load\-bearing capacity for the rooftop park, which introduces dynamic loads from people running, jumping, and the static load of heavy soil&#x2F;substrate for vegetation\.2
- **RIB \(Steel\): Stabil**\.2
- *Core Responsibilities:* Stabil specializes in the steel structures\. Their involvement is particularly notable given the project&#39;s pilot status for reusing offshore steel\.
- *Specific Challenge:* The pergola on the roof utilizes steel cut from the *Curlew FPSO* ship\. Stabil likely performed the structural analysis to verify that these reclaimed maritime steel beams—subjected to decades of salt spray and fatigue at sea—retain sufficient structural properties for use in a permanent civil structure\.1

### **6\.2 RIV: HVAC and Sanitary Engineering \(Rådgivende Ingeniør VVS\)**

The climate control in a sports hall is notoriously difficult due to the large air volume and the need to prevent stratification \(where heat rises to the ceiling, leaving the floor cold\)\.

- **Consulting Engineer \(RIV\): Structor**\.2
- *Responsibilities:* Structor designed the energy, ventilation, and sanitation systems\. They are responsible for ensuring the building meets **Passive House** \(Energy Class A\) standards\. This involves designing highly efficient heat recovery systems and ensuring the building envelope is airtight\.
- **Ventilation Contractor:** **Energima**\.2 Responsible for the physical installation of air handling units and ductwork\.
- **Plumbing Contractor:** **Total VVS**\.2 Responsible for water supply, sewage, and sanitary installations\.
- **Exterior Water&#x2F;Sewage \(RIVA\):** **Stener Sørensen**\.2 Responsible for the connection of the building to the municipal water grid and the management of stormwater \(Overvannshåndtering\), a critical aspect given the large park surface area\.

### **6\.3 RIE: Electrical Engineering \(Rådgivende Ingeniør Elektro\)**

- **Consulting Engineer \(RIE\): Fremst**\.2
- *Scope:* Fremst was engaged for the &quot;Detaljprosjektering&quot; \(Detailed Engineering\)\. Their specific tasks included the creation of the 3D electrical model and the production of working drawings\.
- *Client Relationship:* Unlike the other consultants who might be contracted directly by the General Contractor, Fremst was hired by the electrical subcontractor, Torshov Elektro\. This is a common model in Norway known as &quot;Samspill&quot; or subcontractor\-led engineering\.
- *Key Systems:* Power distribution, lighting design \(essential for sports standards and park safety\), and charging infrastructure\.
- **Electrical Contractor:** **Torshov Elektro**\.2 The executing party responsible for all cabling, switchboards, and fixture installation\.

### **6\.4 Miljørådgiver: Environmental Consultant**

- **RIM \(Miljø\) &amp; RIMg \(Miljøgeologi\): Rambøll**\.2
- *Strategic Role:* Rambøll acts as the guardian of the project&#39;s environmental ambitions\. As RIM, they oversee compliance with BREEAM or similar environmental certifications, monitor the &quot;Fossil\-Free Construction Site&quot; metrics, and manage the materials budget to ensure low\-carbon choices \(like Low\-Carbon Concrete Class A or B\)\.
- *Geological Role \(RIMg\):* As environmental geologists, they are responsible for analyzing soil samples from the site\. Given Løren&#39;s industrial past, there is a high probability of contaminated soil\. Rambøll develops the tiltaksplan \(action plan\) for how these masses are handled, cleaned, or deposited safely\.

## **7\. Specialized Consultants and Subcontractors**

The complexity of the Løren project necessitates expertise beyond the standard &quot;Big Three&quot; engineering disciplines \(Structure, Electrical, HVAC\)\. The research identified the following specialists:

### **7\.1 Fire Safety \(RIBr\): Intec Norge**

**Intec Norge** is the Fire Safety Consultant\.2

- *Mandate:* Designing the fire strategy for a building that is partially underground is complex\. Escape routes must be carefully calculated since windows cannot be used as secondary escapes in subterranean sections\. Intec also designs the smoke ventilation systems, ensuring that the large volume of the sports hall can be cleared of smoke rapidly to allow safe evacuation\.

### **7\.2 Geotechnics \(RIG\): Paya Solutions**

**Paya Solutions** provides Geotechnical Engineering\.2

- *Mandate:* The building is founded on bedrock \(&quot;fundamentert til fjell&quot;\)\. Paya Solutions would have conducted the ground investigations \(core drilling\) and calculated the bearing capacity of the rock\. They also design the blasting plan if rock excavation was required to sink the hall into the terrain\.

### **7\.3 Acoustics \(RIAku\): WSP**

**WSP** is the Acoustics Consultant\.2

- *Mandate:* Sports halls are prone to high reverberation times \(echo\), which can make them noisy and chaotic\. WSP designs the acoustic paneling \(often integrated into walls and ceilings\) to dampen sound\. Furthermore, because there is a park *on top* of the hall, WSP must design the sound insulation to prevent impact noise \(footsteps, basketballs bouncing\) from the roof transmitting into the hall below, and vice versa\.

### **7\.4 ITB \(Integration of Technical Building Systems\): ED Prosjekt**

**ED Prosjekt** serves as the ITB Coordinator\.2

- *Mandate:* ITB \(*Integrerte Tekniske Bygningsinstallasjoner*\) is a critical role in modern Norwegian construction\. ED Prosjekt ensures that the ventilation, heating, lighting, and access control systems &quot;talk&quot; to each other via the SD\-anlegg \(Central Operation System\)\. They oversee the testing and commissioning phase to ensure the building functions as a unified machine\.

## **8\. Innovation Case Study: The Circular Economy Pilot**

The Løren Activity Park project is distinguished by its aggressive pursuit of circular economy principles\. This is not merely a &quot;nice\-to\-have&quot; feature but a core engineering challenge that involves the entire team \(Architect, RIB, Miljørådgiver, and Contractor\)\.

### **8\.1 The &quot;Curlew FPSO&quot; Steel Reuse**

In a world\-first initiative, the project utilizes steel cut from the *Curlew FPSO*, a retired oil production ship that operated in the North Sea for over 20 years\.1

- **The Process:** The ship was decommissioned by **AF Offshore Decom**\. The steel plates and profiles were then processed by **Nordic Circles** and **Skanska Stålfabrikken**\.
- **Application:** This &quot;upcycled&quot; steel is used to construct the pergola structures in the activity park\.
- **Significance:** Global construction accounts for ~40% of CO2 emissions\. Reusing steel avoids the massive energy cost of melting and re\-rolling new steel\. However, it requires the structural engineer \(**Stabil**\) to certify material that theoretically has &quot;expired&quot; its original design life\.

### **8\.2 Concrete and Granite Reuse**

The project also salvages materials from local demolition sites\. Concrete facade elements and granite stones from **Stig Skole** at Stovner are being repurposed for the Løren facade and park landscape\.1 This reduces the need for new concrete production \(a major CO2 source\) and preserves the historical patina of the Oslo region&#39;s built environment\.

## **10\. Conclusion**

The search for the project team behind the **Løren Activity Park and Multi\-Purpose Hall** reveals a complex ecosystem of specialized partners, each selected to meet the rigorous demands of Oslo Municipality&#39;s green shift\. While **Oslobygg KF** provides the vision and capital, and **Håndverkskompaniet AS** drives the physical execution, the project&#39;s success relies heavily on the &quot;missing&quot; engineering links identified in this report\.

The distinction between **PIR2 Arkitekter** \(Building&#x2F;Park Design\) and **LPO Arkitekter** \(Zoning\) is crucial for accurate attribution\. Furthermore, the engineering consortium of **Pro Consult**, **Structor**, **Fremst**, and **Rambøll** illustrates the high level of technical competence required to deliver a Passive House facility that doubles as a subterranean load\-bearing structure for a public park\.

Ultimately, this project serves as a pilot for the future of urban construction in Norway\. Through the integration of the **Curlew FPSO** steel and the strict adherence to fossil\-free site operations, the Løren team is demonstrating that public infrastructure can be the driver for circular economy innovation, transforming an industrial legacy into a sustainable, social asset for the Løren community\.
